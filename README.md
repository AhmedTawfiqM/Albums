## Description
The app is composed of 2 screens, first is the profile screen, it has the user name and address  pinned at the top and then it lists all of this userâ€™s albums. You can get user albums by requesting  the albums endpoint and passing user id as a parameter. 
When you press on any album it navigates to the second screen which is an album details screen.  You request the photos endpoint and pass album id as a parameter, then list the images in an  instagram-like grid. Also there should be a search bar that you can filter within the album by the  image title, when you start typing the screen should show only images that are related to this  search query.
